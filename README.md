# Daily Astrological Insight

A small, modular Python service that infers a zodiac sign from a birth date and generates a concise daily insight using OpenAI. Includes a REST API (FastAPI) and a CLI (Typer).

## Features
- Western zodiac sign inference based on birth date
- OpenAI-backed natural language generation for the final insight
- REST API and CLI entry points

## Requirements
- Python 3.13
- An OpenAI API key available via the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

## Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set your OpenAI key (zsh/bash):
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

## Run the REST API
From the project root:
```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

Health check:
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Create an insight:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/insight \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "name": "Sadiva",
  "birth_date": "1999-04-02",
  "birth_time": "14:30",
  "birth_place": "Delhi, India"
}'
```
Example response:
```json
{
    "zodiac": "Aries",
    "insight": "Today, Sadiva, embrace your adventurous spirit by exploring new ideas and perspectives. Take a bold step in your learning journeyâ€”whether it's picking up a book outside your usual interests or joining a workshop. Your curiosity can lead to exciting discoveries, so trust your instincts and let your energy guide you!"
}
```

## CLI Usage
With the virtualenv active:
```bash
python cli.py insight \
  --name Ritika \
  --birth-date 1995-08-20 \
  --birth-time 14:30 \
  --birth-place "Jaipur, India"
```
This will output JSON containing the inferred `zodiac` and the generated `insight`.

## Notes
- The current orchestrator calls OpenAI directly for generation. Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set.
- In-memory caching is keyed by `(name, sign, date)` to avoid repeated calls for the same input on the same day.
- The daily theme and simple personalization help keep guidance fresh while remaining concise.
- Zodiac inference uses standard Western sun sign date ranges.
